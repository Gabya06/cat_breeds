# 🐾 Project Overview: Zero-Shot Cat Breed Classification with CLIP

This project explores the use of **multimodal machine learning** for classifying cat breeds in a zero-shot setting using [CLIP](https://openai.com/research/clip) (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining).

Rather than training a model on labeled cat breed images, we leverage CLIP's ability to align images and natural language descriptions in a **shared embedding space**.

## ✨ Components

### 🧠 Zero-Shot Breed Classification (CLIP)
- **Approach**: Embed cat breed descriptions from the [CAT API](https://thecatapi.com/).
- **Compare**: Compute cosine similarity between image embeddings and text embeddings.
- **Goal**: Determine the most likely breed **without supervised training**.

### 📚 RAG Q&A with ChromaDB
- Use a vector store ([ChromaDB](https://docs.trychroma.com/docs/overview/getting-started)) to **retrieve breed documents**.
- Filter with metadata (origin, coat length, temperament).
- Pass relevant text chunks to **Gemini** or **OpenAI LLMs** for final answers.

### 🧪 Image Generation (Optional)
- Use Gemini Vision to **generate cat images** for unseen breeds.
- Fine-tune embeddings or test zero-shot inference with synthetic data.

## 🔬 Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| CLIP Embeddings | Map images + text to a shared vector space |
| Cosine Similarity | Used to rank closest breed descriptions |
| RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) | Combine retrieval (ChromaDB) with generation (LLMs) |
| Gemini / OpenAI | LLMs used for breed-specific Q&A and summaries |
| Multimodal AI | Bridging vision + language for understanding cats |

## 🗂 File Breakdown

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `data_processing.py` | Fetch + format breed data from CAT API |
| `qa.py` | Embed + query breed metadata via ChromaDB |
| `clip.py` | Perform image-text similarity using CLIP |
| `embed.py` | Embed text and images using CLIP |
| `inference.py` | Predict cat breeds using CLIP & ChromaDB |
| `utils/embedding_functions.py` | Embedding functions for CLIP |
| `utils/utils.py` | ChromaDB functionality |

## 📈 Why It Matters

This project is a compact demo of how **foundation models** (CLIP, Gemini) can be combined with RAG architecture for **domain-specific tasks** — in this case, cats. It shows that:

- You can skip supervised training for many visual tasks using **zero-shot models**
- **Semantic search** can dramatically improve the relevance of answers
- It's possible to combine retrieval, generation, and vision in a clean pipeline
